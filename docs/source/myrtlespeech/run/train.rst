.. autofunction:: myrtlespeech.run.train.fit

    The training loop is kept as simple and generic as possible whilst being
    highly adaptable through the use of :doc:`callbacks <callbacks/index>`.
    The entire code is as follows:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/myrtlespeech/run/train.py
        :start-after: sphinx-doc-start-after
        :end-before: sphinx-doc-end-before
